# Configuration

Open **Dashboard → Plugins → Hyperion Grabber**. Settings are saved with **Save**; the **Test connection** and
**Send test pattern** buttons use the values currently in the form, so you can try them before saving.

## Hyperion server

| Setting | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Host** | *(empty)* | Host name or IP address of the machine running Hyperion.ng or HyperHDR. See [Docker notes](installation.md#docker-notes) if Jellyfin runs in a container. |
| **FlatBuffers port** | `19400` | Port of Hyperion's FlatBuffers server. Not the web UI port (8090) and not the JSON-RPC port (19444). |
| **Priority** | `150` | Hyperion priority of the Jellyfin picture, 100-199. Lower numbers win. |

### Choosing a priority

Hyperion shows the source with the **lowest** priority number that is active. Typical values:

| Source | Usual priority |
| --- | --- |
| Colors/effects set manually in the Hyperion UI or apps | 1 - 50 |
| **Jellyfin (this plugin)** | **150** |
| Hyperion's own USB/screen grabbers | 240 - 250 |
| Background effect | 254 |

With the default, starting a movie overrides grabbers and the background effect, while a color you pick in the
Hyperion app still wins. Hyperion.ng only accepts 100-199 from FlatBuffers clients.

## Playback settings *(planned)*

The next releases add: which devices/users trigger the lights, what happens on pause (default: hold the last
frame), capture size and frame rate, a latency offset, HDR tone mapping, and multiple Hyperion targets (one per TV).
See the [roadmap](../roadmap.md).
